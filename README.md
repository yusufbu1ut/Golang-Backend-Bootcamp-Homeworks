# Golang-Backend-Bootcamp-Homeworks
In this repository, there are projects that I have realized during the bootcamp.


These assignments were carried out on books and authors within the scope of the library system.

### Homework-1
In this assignment, operations were performed through the console.

### Homework-2
This assignment is a continuation of the first assignment with additional features added.

### Homework-3
In this assignment, previous operations were performed and moved to DB using Gorm.

### Homework-4
This assignment is a composite of all assignments and finally a REST API implementation is provided.
